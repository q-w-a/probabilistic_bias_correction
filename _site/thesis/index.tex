% This is the Reed College LaTeX thesis template. Most of the work

% Your comments and suggestions are more than welcome; please email

% See https://www.reed.edu/cis/help/LaTeX/index.html for help. There are a
% great bunch of help pages there, with notes on
% getting started, bibtex, etc. Go there and read it if you're not
% already familiar with LaTeX.
%
% Any line that starts with a percent symbol is a comment.
% They won't show up in the document, and are useful for notes
% to yourself and explaining commands.
% Commenting also removes a line from the document;
% very handy for troubleshooting problems. -BTS

% As far as I know, this follows the requirements laid out in
% the 2002-2003 Senior Handbook. Ask a librarian to check the

\Abstract{
As we have navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, case counts have been a central source of information for understanding transmission dynamics and the effect of public health interventions. However, because the number of cases we observe is limited by the testing effort in a given location, the case counts presented on local or national dashboards are only a fraction of the true infections. Variations in testing rate by time and location impacts the number of cases that go unobserved, which can cloud our understanding of the true COVID-19 incidence at a given time point and can create biases in downstream analyses. Additionally, the number of cases we observe is impacted by the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test. To quantify the number of true infections given incomplete testing and diagnostic test inaccuracy, this work implements probabilistic bias analysis at a biweekly time scale from January 1, 2021 through February 2022. In doing so, we can estimate a range of possible true infections for a given time interval and location. This approach can be applied at the state level across the United States, as well as in some counties where the needed data are available.
