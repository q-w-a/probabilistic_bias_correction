Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) is widely used for SARS-CoV-2 detection but may be limited by the continuous evolution of the virus. However, the sensitivity of Chinese commercial rRT-PCR kits to critical SARS-CoV-2 variants remains unknown. In this study, contrived MS2 virus-like particles were used as reference materials to evaluate the analytical sensitivity of Daan, BioGerm, EasyDiagnosis, Liferiver, and Sansure kits when detecting six important variants (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron, and Fin-796H). The Beta and Delta variants adversely affected the analytical sensitivity of the BioGerm ORF1ab gene assay (9.52% versus 42.96%,\n              P\n               = 0.014, and 14.29% versus 42.96%,\n              P\n               = 0.040, respectively), whereas the N gene assay completely failed in terms of the Fin-796H variant. The Gamma and Fin-796H variants impeded the PCR amplification efficiency for the Sansure ORF1ab gene assay (33.33% versus 66.67%,\n              P\n               = 0.031, and 66.67% versus 95.24%,\n              P\n               = 0.040, respectively), and the Delta variant compromised the E gene assay (52.38% versus 85.71%,\n              P\n               = 0.019). The Alpha and Omicron variants had no significant effect on the kits. This study highlights the necessity of identifying the potential effect of viral mutations on the efficacy and sensitivity of clinical detection assays. It can also provide helpful insights regarding the development and optimization of diagnostic assays and aid the strategic management of the ongoing pandemic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Yuqing"},{"family":"Han","given":"Yanxi"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jinming"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Rui"}],"citation-key":"chen2022","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","container-title-short":"J Clin Microbiol","DOI":"10.1128/jcm.02374-21","editor":[{"family":"Tang","given":"Yi-Wei"}],"ISSN":"0095-1137, 1098-660X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,20]]},"language":"en","page":"e02374-21","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Variants on the Analytical Sensitivity of rRT-PCR Assays","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jcm.02374-21","volume":"60"},
  {"id":"cuadros2022c","abstract":"Objective\n              The US recently suffered the fourth and most severe wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This wave was driven by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron, a highly transmissible variant that infected even vaccinated people. Vaccination coverage disparities have played an important role in shaping the epidemic dynamics. Analyzing the epidemiological impact of this uneven vaccination coverage is essential to understand local differences in the spread and outcomes of the Omicron wave. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the impact of vaccination coverage disparity in the US in the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic during the third and fourth waves of the pandemic driven by the Delta and Omicron variants.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This cross-sectional study used COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination coverage from 2,417 counties. The main outcomes of the study were new COVID-19 cases (incidence rate per 100,000 people) and new COVID-19 related deaths (mortality rate per 100,000 people) at county level and the main exposure variable was COVID-19 vaccination rate at county level. Geospatial and data visualization analyses were used to estimate the association between vaccination rate and COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates for the Delta and Omicron waves.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              During the Omicron wave, areas with high vaccination rates (&gt;60%) experienced 1.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–1.7) times higher COVID-19 incidence rate compared to areas with low vaccination rates (&lt;40%). However, mortality rate was 1.6 (95% CI 1.5–1.7) higher in these low-vaccinated areas compared to areas with vaccination rates higher than 60%. As a result, areas with low vaccination rate had a 2.2 (95% CI 2.1–2.2) times higher case-fatality ratio. Geospatial clustering analysis showed a more defined spatial structure during the Delta wave with clusters with low vaccination rates and high incidence and mortality located in southern states.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Despite the emergence of new virus variants with differential transmission potential, the protective effect of vaccines keeps generating marked differences in the distribution of critical health outcomes, with low vaccinated areas having the largest COVID-19 related mortality during the Delta and Omicron waves in the US.

Repeat testing was performed for 3,432 patients, of which 2,413 had initial negative and 802 had initial positive results. Repeat-tested patients were more likely to have severe disease and low viral loads. The negative predictive value of the first-day result among repeat-tested patients was 81.3% The clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays was estimated between 58% and 96%, depending on the unknown number of false-negative results in single-tested patients. Conversion to negative was unlikely to occur before 15 to 20 days after initial testing or 20 to 30 days after the onset of symptoms, with 50% conversion occurring at 28 days after initial testing. Conversion from first-day negative to positive results increased linearly with each day of testing, reaching 25% probability in 20 days. Sixty patients fluctuated between positive and negative results over several weeks, suggesting that caution is needed when single-test results are acted upon. In summary, our study provides estimates of the clinical performance of SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays and suggests time frames for appropriate repeat testing, namely, 15 to 20 days after a positive test and the same day or next 2 days after a negative test for patients with high suspicion for COVID-19.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Green","given":"Daniel A."},{"family":"Zucker","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Westblade","given":"Lars F."},{"family":"Whittier","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Rennert","given":"Hanna"},{"family":"Velu","given":"Priya"},{"family":"Craney","given":"Arryn"},{"family":"Cushing","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Dakai"},{"family":"Sobieszczyk","given":"Magdalena E."},{"family":"Boehme","given":"Amelia K."},{"family":"Sepulveda","given":"Jorge L."}],"citation-key":"green2020","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","container-title-short":"J Clin Microbiol","DOI":"10.1128/JCM.00995-20","editor":[{"family":"McAdam","given":"Alexander J."}],"ISSN":"0095-1137, 1098-660X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,23]]},"language":"en","page":"e00995-20","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Clinical Performance of SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Tests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/JCM.00995-20","volume":"58"},

Performance of many SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR assays is not entirely known due to the lack of a gold standard. We sought to evaluate the false negative rate (FNR) and sensitivity of our laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR targeting the envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) genes.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR results at the Public Health Laboratory (Alberta, Canada) from January 21 to April 18, 2020 were reviewed to identify patients with an initial negative rtRT-PCR followed by a positive result on repeat testing within 14 days (defined as discordant results). Negative samples from these discordant specimens were re-tested using three alternate rtRT-PCR assays (targeting the E gene and N1/N2 regions of the nucleocapsid genes) to assess for false negative (FN) results.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              During the time period specified, 95,919 patients (100,001 samples) were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 49 patients were found to have discordant results including 49 positive and 52 negative swabs. Repeat testing of 52 negative swabs found five FNs (from five separate patients). Assuming 100% specificity of the diagnostic assay, the FNR and sensitivity in this group of patients with discordant testing was 9.3% (95% CI 1.5–17.0%) and 90.7% (95% CI 82.6–98.9%) respectively.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Studies to understand the FNR of routinely used assays are important to confirm adequate clinical performance. In this study, most FN results were due to low amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus concentrations in patients with multiple specimens collected during different stages of infection.

Adults who were clinically suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, with sufficient data in their medical records for grading of clinical suspicion were eligible.

  {"id":"reinhart2021","abstract":"Significance\n            To study the COVID-19 pandemic, its effects on society, and measures for reducing its spread, researchers need detailed data on the course of the pandemic. Standard public health data streams suffer inconsistent reporting and frequent, unexpected revisions. They also miss other aspects of a population’s behavior that are worthy of consideration. We present an open database of COVID signals in the United States, measured at the county level and updated daily. This includes traditionally reported COVID cases and deaths, and many others: measures of mobility, social distancing, internet search trends, self-reported symptoms, and patterns of COVID-related activity in deidentified medical insurance claims. The database provides all signals in a common, easy-to-use format, empowering both public health research and operational decision-making.\n          , \n            The COVID-19 pandemic presented enormous data challenges in the United States. Policy makers, epidemiological modelers, and health researchers all require up-to-date data on the pandemic and relevant public behavior, ideally at fine spatial and temporal resolution. The COVIDcast API is our attempt to fill this need: Operational since April 2020, it provides open access to both traditional public health surveillance signals (cases, deaths, and hospitalizations) and many auxiliary indicators of COVID-19 activity, such as signals extracted from deidentified medical claims data, massive online surveys, cell phone mobility data, and internet search trends. These are available at a fine geographic resolution (mostly at the county level) and are updated daily. The COVIDcast API also tracks all revisions to historical data, allowing modelers to account for the frequent revisions and backfill that are common for many public health data sources. All of the data are available in a common format through the API and accompanying R and Python software packages. This paper describes the data sources and signals, and provides examples demonstrating that the auxiliary signals in the COVIDcast API present information relevant to tracking COVID activity, augmenting traditional public health reporting and empowering research and decision-making.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Reinhart","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Brooks","given":"Logan"},{"family":"Jahja","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Rumack","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Jingjing"},{"family":"Agrawal","given":"Sumit"},{"family":"Al Saeed","given":"Wael"},{"family":"Arnold","given":"Taylor"},{"family":"Basu","given":"Amartya"},{"family":"Bien","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Cabrera","given":"Ángel A."},{"family":"Chin","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Chua","given":"Eu Jing"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Colquhoun","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"DeFries","given":"Nat"},{"family":"Farrow","given":"David C."},{"family":"Forlizzi","given":"Jodi"},{"family":"Grabman","given":"Jed"},{"family":"Gratzl","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Green","given":"Alden"},{"family":"Haff","given":"George"},{"family":"Han","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Harwood","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Addison J."},{"family":"Hyde","given":"Raphael"},{"family":"Hyun","given":"Sangwon"},{"family":"Joshi","given":"Ananya"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jimi"},{"family":"Kuznetsov","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"La Motte-Kerr","given":"Wichada"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Yeon Jin"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Kenneth"},{"family":"Lipton","given":"Zachary C."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Michael X."},{"family":"Mackey","given":"Lester"},{"family":"Mazaitis","given":"Kathryn"},{"family":"McDonald","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"McGuinness","given":"Phillip"},{"family":"Narasimhan","given":"Balasubramanian"},{"family":"O’Brien","given":"Michael P."},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Natalia L."},{"family":"Patil","given":"Pratik"},{"family":"Perer","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Politsch","given":"Collin A."},{"family":"Rajanala","given":"Samyak"},{"family":"Rucker","given":"Dawn"},{"family":"Scott","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Nigam H."},{"family":"Shankar","given":"Vishnu"},{"family":"Sharpnack","given":"James"},{"family":"Shemetov","given":"Dmitry"},{"family":"Simon","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Benjamin Y."},{"family":"Srivastava","given":"Vishakha"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Shuyi"},{"family":"Tibshirani","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Tuzhilina","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Van Nortwick","given":"Ana Karina"},{"family":"Ventura","given":"Valérie"},{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Larry"},{"family":"Weaver","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Jeremy C."},{"family":"Whitman","given":"Spencer"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Kristin"},{"family":"Rosenfeld","given":"Roni"},{"family":"Tibshirani","given":"Ryan J."}],"citation-key":"reinhart2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"wuSubstantialUnderestimationSARSCoV22020","abstract":"Abstract\n            Accurate estimates of the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection are critical to informing pandemic response. Confirmed COVID-19 case counts in the U.S. do not capture the total burden of the pandemic because testing has been primarily restricted to individuals with moderate to severe symptoms due to limited test availability. Here, we use a semi-Bayesian probabilistic bias analysis to account for incomplete testing and imperfect diagnostic accuracy. We estimate 6,454,951 cumulative infections compared to 721,245 confirmed cases (1.9% vs. 0.2% of the population) in the United States as of April 18, 2020. Accounting for uncertainty, the number of infections during this period was 3 to 20 times higher than the number of confirmed cases. 86% (simulation interval: 64–99%) of this difference is due to incomplete testing, while 14% (0.3–36%) is due to imperfect test accuracy. The approach can readily be applied in future studies in other locations or at finer spatial scale to correct for biased testing and imperfect diagnostic accuracy to provide a more realistic assessment of COVID-19 burden.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Sean L."},{"family":"Mertens","given":"Andrew N."},{"family":"Crider","given":"Yoshika S."},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Pokpongkiat","given":"Nolan N."},{"family":"Djajadi","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Seth","given":"Anmol"},{"family":"Hsiang","given":"Michelle S."},{"family":"Colford","given":"John M."},{"family":"Reingold","given":"Art"},{"family":"Arnold","given":"Benjamin F."},{"family":"Hubbard","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Benjamin-Chung","given":"Jade"}],"citation-key":"wuSubstantialUnderestimationSARSCoV22020","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-020-18272-4","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12]]},"language":"en","page":"4507","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Substantial underestimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18272-4","volume":"11"}
