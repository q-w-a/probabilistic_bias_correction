  abstract = {Objective               The US recently suffered the fourth and most severe wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This wave was driven by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron, a highly transmissible variant that infected even vaccinated people. Vaccination coverage disparities have played an important role in shaping the epidemic dynamics. Analyzing the epidemiological impact of this uneven vaccination coverage is essential to understand local differences in the spread and outcomes of the Omicron wave. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the impact of vaccination coverage disparity in the US in the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic during the third and fourth waves of the pandemic driven by the Delta and Omicron variants.                                         Methods               This cross-sectional study used COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination coverage from 2,417 counties. The main outcomes of the study were new COVID-19 cases (incidence rate per 100,000 people) and new COVID-19 related deaths (mortality rate per 100,000 people) at county level and the main exposure variable was COVID-19 vaccination rate at county level. Geospatial and data visualization analyses were used to estimate the association between vaccination rate and COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates for the Delta and Omicron waves.                                         Results               During the Omicron wave, areas with high vaccination rates (\&gt;60\%) experienced 1.4 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–1.7) times higher COVID-19 incidence rate compared to areas with low vaccination rates (\&lt;40\%). However, mortality rate was 1.6 (95\% CI 1.5–1.7) higher in these low-vaccinated areas compared to areas with vaccination rates higher than 60\%. As a result, areas with low vaccination rate had a 2.2 (95\% CI 2.1–2.2) times higher case-fatality ratio. Geospatial clustering analysis showed a more defined spatial structure during the Delta wave with clusters with low vaccination rates and high incidence and mortality located in southern states.                                         Conclusions               Despite the emergence of new virus variants with differential transmission potential, the protective effect of vaccines keeps generating marked differences in the distribution of critical health outcomes, with low vaccinated areas having the largest COVID-19 related mortality during the Delta and Omicron waves in the US. Vulnerable communities residing in low vaccinated areas, which are mostly rural, are suffering the highest burden of the COVID-19 pandemic during the vaccination era.},

Aim:               The aim of this study was to examine whether the initial disease severity affects the risk of persistent symptoms in post-acute COVID-19 syndrome and long COVID.                                         Methods:               A systematic search was conducted using PUBMED, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and ProQuest databases to identify eligible articles published after January 2020 up to and including 30 August 2021. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random effects meta-analysis.                                         Findings:               After searching a total of 7733 articles, 20 relevant observational studies with a total of 7840 patients were selected for meta-analysis. The pooled OR for persistent dyspnea in COVID-19 survivors with a severe versus nonsevere initial disease was 2.17 [95\%CI 1.62 to 2.90], and it was 1.33 [95\%CI 0.75 to 2.33] for persistent cough, 1.30 [95\%CI 1.06 to 1.58] for persistent fatigue, 1.02 [95\%CI 0.73 to 1.40] for persistent anosmia, 1.22 [95\%CI 0.69 to 2.16] for persistent chest pain, and 1.30 [95\%CI 0.93 to 1.81] for persistent palpitation.                                         Conclusions:               Contrary to expectations, we did not observe an association between the initial COVID-19 disease severity and common persistent symptoms except for dyspnea and fatigue. In addition, it was found that being in the acute or prolonged post-COVID phase did not affect the risk of symptoms. Primary care providers should be alert to potential most prevalent persistent symptoms in all COVID-19 survivors, which are not limited to patients with critical–severe initial disease.},

  abstract = {Significance             The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 33 million people in the United States. Nationwide, over 600,000 have died in the COVID-19 pandemic, which has necessitated shutdowns of schools and sectors of the economy. The extent of the virus’ spread remains uncertain due to biases in test data. We combine multiple data sources to estimate the true number of infections in all US states. These data include representative random testing surveys from Indiana and Ohio, which provide potentially unbiased prevalence estimates. We find that approximately 60\% of infections have gone unreported. Even so, only about 20\% of the United States had been infected as of early March 2021, suggesting that the country was far from herd immunity at that point.           ,              There are multiple sources of data giving information about the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the population, but all have major drawbacks, including biases and delayed reporting. For example, the number of confirmed cases largely underestimates the number of infections, and deaths lag infections substantially, while test positivity rates tend to greatly overestimate prevalence. Representative random prevalence surveys, the only putatively unbiased source, are sparse in time and space, and the results can come with big delays. Reliable estimates of population prevalence are necessary for understanding the spread of the virus and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. We develop a simple Bayesian framework to estimate viral prevalence by combining several of the main available data sources. It is based on a discrete-time Susceptible–Infected–Removed (SIR) model with time-varying reproductive parameter. Our model includes likelihood components that incorporate data on deaths due to the virus, confirmed cases, and the number of tests administered on each day. We anchor our inference with data from random-sample testing surveys in Indiana and Ohio. We use the results from these two states to calibrate the model on positive test counts and proceed to estimate the infection fatality rate and the number of new infections on each day in each state in the United States. We estimate the extent to which reported COVID cases have underestimated true infection counts, which was large, especially in the first months of the pandemic. We explore the implications of our results for progress toward herd immunity.},

  abstract = {Objective               We examined the association between stay-at-home order implementation and the incidence of COVID-19 infections and deaths in rural versus urban counties of the United States.                                         Design               We used an interrupted time-series analysis using a mixed effects zero-inflated Poisson model with random intercept by county and standardised by population to examine the associations between stay-at-home orders and county-level counts of daily new COVID-19 cases and deaths in rural versus urban counties between 22 January 2020 and 10 June 2020. We secondarily examined the association between stay-at-home orders and mobility in rural versus urban counties using Google Community Mobility Reports.                                         Interventions               Issuance of stay-at-home orders.                                         Primary and secondary outcome measures               Co-primary outcomes were COVID-19 daily incidence of cases (14-day lagged) and mortality (26-day lagged). Secondary outcome was mobility.                                         Results               Stay-at-home orders were implemented later (median 30 March 2020 vs 28 March 2020) and were shorter in duration (median 35 vs 54 days) in rural compared with urban counties. Indoor mobility was, on average, 2.6\%–6.9\% higher in rural than urban counties both during and after stay-at-home orders. Compared with the baseline (pre-stay-at-home) period, the number of new COVID-19 cases increased under stay-at-home by incidence risk ratio (IRR) 1.60 (95\% CI, 1.57 to 1.64) in rural and 1.36 (95\% CI, 1.30 to 1.42) in urban counties, while the number of new COVID-19 deaths increased by IRR 14.21 (95\% CI, 11.02 to 18.34) in rural and IRR 2.93 in urban counties (95\% CI, 1.82 to 4.73). For each day under stay-at-home orders, the number of new cases changed by a factor of 0.982 (95\% CI, 0.981 to 0.982) in rural and 0.952 (95\% CI, 0.951 to 0.953) in urban counties compared with prior to stay-at-home, while number of new deaths changed by a factor of 0.977 (95\% CI, 0.976 to 0.977) in rural counties and 0.935 (95\% CI, 0.933 to 0.936) in urban counties. Each day after stay-at-home orders expired, the number of new cases changed by a factor of 0.995 (95\% CI, 0.994 to 0.995) in rural and 0.997 (95\% CI, 0.995 to 0.999) in urban counties compared with prior to stay-at-home, while number of new deaths changed by a factor of 0.969 (95\% CI, 0.968 to 0.970) in rural counties and 0.928 (95\% CI, 0.926 to 0.929) in urban counties.                                         Conclusion               Stay-at-home orders decreased mobility, slowed the spread of COVID-19 and mitigated COVID-19 mortality, but did so less effectively in rural than in urban counties. This necessitates a critical re-evaluation of how stay-at-home orders are designed, communicated and implemented in rural areas.},

  abstract = {Objective:               State-issued behavioral policy interventions (BPIs) can limit community spread of COVID-19, but their effects on COVID-19 transmission may vary by level of social vulnerability in the community. We examined the association between the duration of BPIs and the incidence of COVID-19 across levels of social vulnerability in US counties.                                         Methods:               We used COVID-19 case counts from USAFacts and policy data on BPIs (face mask mandates, stay-at-home orders, gathering bans) in place from April through December 2020 and the 2018 Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We conducted multilevel linear regression to estimate the associations between duration of each BPI and monthly incidence of COVID-19 (cases per 100\,000 population) by SVI quartiles (grouped as low, moderate low, moderate high, and high social vulnerability) for 3141 US counties.                                         Results:               Having a BPI in place for longer durations (ie, ≥2 months) was associated with lower incidence of COVID-19 compared with having a BPI in place for {$<$}1 month. Compared with having no BPI in place or a BPI in place for {$<$}1 month, differences in marginal mean monthly incidence of COVID-19 per 100\,000 population for a BPI in place for ≥2 months ranged from –4 cases in counties with low SVI to –401 cases in counties with high SVI for face mask mandates, from –31 cases in counties with low SVI to –208 cases in counties with high SVI for stay-at-home orders, and from –227 cases in counties with low SVI to –628 cases in counties with high SVI for gathering bans.                                         Conclusions:               Establishing COVID-19 prevention measures for longer durations may help reduce COVID-19 transmission, especially in communities with high levels of social vulnerability.},

  abstract = {Case-control studies are particularly susceptible to differential exposure misclassification when exposure status is determined following incident case status. Probabilistic bias analysis methods have been developed as ways to adjust standard effect estimates based on the sensitivity and specificity of exposure misclassification. The iterative sampling method advocated in probabilistic bias analysis bears a distinct resemblance to a Bayesian adjustment; however, it is not identical. Furthermore, without a formal theoretical framework (Bayesian or frequentist), the results of a probabilistic bias analysis remain somewhat difficult to interpret. We describe, both theoretically and empirically, the extent to which probabilistic bias analysis can be viewed as approximately Bayesian. Although the differences between probabilistic bias analysis and Bayesian approaches to misclassification can be substantial, these situations often involve unrealistic prior specifications and are relatively easy to detect. Outside of these special cases, probabilistic bias analysis and Bayesian approaches to exposure misclassification in case-control studies appear to perform equally well.},

This systematic review aimed to describe how QBA has been applied in epidemiological research in 2006–19.                                         Methods               We searched PubMed for English peer-reviewed studies applying QBA to real-data applications. We also included studies citing selected sources or which were identified in a previous QBA review in pharmacoepidemiology. For each study, we extracted the rationale, methodology, bias-adjusted results and interpretation and assessed factors associated with reproducibility.                                         Results               Of the 238 studies, the majority were embedded within papers whose main inferences were drawn from conventional approaches as secondary (sensitivity) analyses to quantity-specific biases (52\%) or to assess the extent of bias required to shift the point estimate to the null (25\%); 10\% were standalone papers. The most common approach was probabilistic (57\%). Misclassification was modelled in 57\%, uncontrolled confounder(s) in 40\% and selection bias in 17\%. Most did not consider multiple biases or correlations between errors. When specified, bias parameters came from the literature (48\%) more often than internal validation studies (29\%). The majority (60\%) of analyses resulted in \&gt;10\% change from the conventional point estimate; however, most investigators (63\%) did not alter their original interpretation. Degree of reproducibility related to inclusion of code, formulas, sensitivity analyses and supplementary materials, as well as the QBA rationale.                                         Conclusions               QBA applications were rare though increased over time. Future investigators should reference good practices and include details to promote transparency and to serve as a reference for other researchers.},

  abstract = {Significance             Asymptomatic infections have been widely reported for COVID-19. However, many studies do not distinguish between the presymptomatic stage and truly asymptomatic infections. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 literature reporting laboratory-confirmed infections to determine the burden of asymptomatic infections and removed index cases from our calculations to avoid conflation. By analyzing over 350 papers, we estimated that more than one-third of infections are truly asymptomatic. We found evidence of greater asymptomaticity in children compared with the elderly, and lower asymptomaticity among cases with comorbidities compared to cases with no underlying medical conditions. Greater asymptomaticity at younger ages suggests that heightened vigilance is needed among these individuals, to prevent spillover into the broader community.           ,              Quantification of asymptomatic infections is fundamental for effective public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Discrepancies regarding the extent of asymptomaticity have arisen from inconsistent terminology as well as conflation of index and secondary cases which biases toward lower asymptomaticity. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and World Health Organization Global Research Database on COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and April 2, 2021 to identify studies that reported silent infections at the time of testing, whether presymptomatic or asymptomatic. Index cases were removed to minimize representational bias that would result in overestimation of symptomaticity. By analyzing over 350 studies, we estimate that the percentage of infections that never developed clinical symptoms, and thus were truly asymptomatic, was 35.1\% (95\% CI: 30.7 to 39.9\%). At the time of testing, 42.8\% (95\% prediction interval: 5.2 to 91.1\%) of cases exhibited no symptoms, a group comprising both asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections. Asymptomaticity was significantly lower among the elderly, at 19.7\% (95\% CI: 12.7 to 29.4\%) compared with children at 46.7\% (95\% CI: 32.0 to 62.0\%). We also found that cases with comorbidities had significantly lower asymptomaticity compared to cases with no underlying medical conditions. Without proactive policies to detect asymptomatic infections, such as rapid contact tracing, prolonged efforts for pandemic control may be needed even in the presence of vaccination.},

  abstract = {Significance             The US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) has operated continuously since April 6, 2020, collecting over 20 million responses. As the largest public health survey conducted in the United States to date, CTIS was designed to facilitate detailed demographic and geographic analyses, track trends over time, and accommodate rapid revision to address emerging priorities. Using examples of CTIS results illuminating trends in symptoms, risks, mitigating behaviors, testing, and vaccination in relation to evolving high-priority policy questions over 12 mo of the pandemic, we illustrate the value of online surveys for tracking patterns and trends in COVID outcomes as an adjunct to official reporting, and showcase unique insights that would not be visible through traditional public health reporting.           ,              The US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) is a large, cross-sectional, internet-based survey that has operated continuously since April 6, 2020. By inviting a random sample of Facebook active users each day, CTIS collects information about COVID-19 symptoms, risks, mitigating behaviors, mental health, testing, vaccination, and other key priorities. The large scale of the survey—over 20 million responses in its first year of operation—allows tracking of trends over short timescales and allows comparisons at fine demographic and geographic detail. The survey has been repeatedly revised to respond to emerging public health priorities. In this paper, we describe the survey methods and content and give examples of CTIS results that illuminate key patterns and trends and help answer high-priority policy questions relevant to the COVID-19 epidemic and response. These results demonstrate how large online surveys can provide continuous, real-time indicators of important outcomes that are not subject to public health reporting delays and backlogs. The CTIS offers high value as a supplement to official reporting data by supplying essential information about behaviors, attitudes toward policy and preventive measures, economic impacts, and other topics not reported in public health surveillance systems.},
